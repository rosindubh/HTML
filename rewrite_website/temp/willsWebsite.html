                            Question 1:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                        <h4>What is the purpose of IT in modern business?</h4> Let's imagine a world before online
                        shopping,
                        stock
                        tracking, digital marketing and credit card transactions. So, the 1960's basically. Well,
                        it's
                        2021,
                        and
                        unfortuntaely for your company's accounting department's (depending which way you look at it
                        -
                        job
                        creation,
                        revenue generators etc), all of those things missing from 1970 exist, and they are around
                        for
                        good.
                        Or
                        at least until the next apocolypse.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h4>But what does IT even mean anymore?</h4> No longer the moniker for the 'doss' about in
                        school,
                        the
                        umbrella
                        term of Information Technology can include a whole host of things. Especially when it comes
                        to
                        business.
                        Want to maximise the reach of your services to people? You'll want to be investing in online
                        advertising, digital marketing and the use of a broad spectrum of payment platforms. On that
                        subject;
                        taking card payments, or Paypal, even crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has now
                        become
                        a
                        neccessity, even in person - in shop, or at the market. We are moving into a cashless
                        society,
                        all
                        of
                        which will require IT. Especially to make it safe...</p>
                        <p>What's safer than cash though, right? Tell that to the fiver you left in your
                            recently-tumble-dried
                            jeans. Security and safety when using card payments, online payments, and payment
                            portals/wallets
                            all
                            need cyber security to make safe - and a heck of a lot of back-end development to access
                            the
                            correct
                            amounts of stock, the right bank accounts, and ordering/delivering the products.</p>
                        <aside>We could go on, and on - but let's all agree IT is integral to a modern business to
                            make
                            it
                            in
                            any

                        <p>
                        <h4>What on earth will we need to do that! </h4>So now that we've had a look at what types
                        of IT
                        relevent
                        elements exist in a modern business let's get onto the methods, skills and resources we need
                        to
                        complete
                        our
                        digital projects successfully.</p>
                        <p>Here we go! First of all let's implement some basic project managemnt to our process.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Project overview: We are aiming to
                                achieve a dynamic, responsice site that is compelling and entertaining. The business
                                drivers
                                are
                                to
                                generate revenue, build an strong online audience, and to inform and entertain? The
                                benefits
                                are
                                that it is low maintainence, low cost and potentially high yield.</li>
                            <li>Objectives: To build our site, with multiple responsive pages. To build a strong
                                online
                                following
                                and to develop a cool looking website for people to visit. If we can achieve our
                                main
                                objective
                                of
                                building our website, which we could call<strong>Stage One</strong>, we can consider
                                the
                                endevour a
                                success.</li>
                            <li>Scope: As a solo project, all of the scope can exist within the parametres of my own
                                work
                                limit.
                                I
                                will use office hours, but also ad hoc time managment in order to prioritize
                                elements
                                should
                                they
                                become an obstacle. I will have the use of the cool cats at CodeNation, including
                                Jay my
                                python
                                tutor, to have a look over the work.</li>
                            <li>Assumptions and risks: We can assume I have the knowledge in front-end development
                                coding to
                                achieve
                                this, the risks are that I foresee from the get go, are centred around the creative
                                ideation
                                elemnts
                                of this project: we want this site to be entertaing, engaging, exciting - this needs
                                a
                                killer
                                idea.
                                I have all the hardware, from laptops and chairs to achieve this, and have the
                                domains
                                and
                                offline/online storage to store and upload.</li>
                            <li>Approach: I will cover this more later in my planning stages, but the implementation
                                of
                                Trello
                                boards, Gannt charts and time managemnt methodology will come into play.</li>
                            <li>Organization: I, Caeser - am the sole member of this organisation. Everything rests
                                on
                                me,
                                but
                                that
                                also means I can implement my vision and change direction/overcome speedbumps
                                without
                                the
                                time

                            <p>Using our outlined plan from above it makes sense to get a Trello board on the go.
                                Please
                                find

                                    here.</a> As you
                                can
                                see, I have used a KANBAN template to implement code <span>Review, Backlog, and
                                    Testing</span>
                                alongside
                                your
                                traditional <span>Doing, and Done Lists</span> .</p>

                            <li>Code: I have written most of the semantic HTML from scratch, using minor boilerplate
                                elements. I am also in the process of making the HTML accessible too. I have written
                                all
                                the
                                css, </li>
                            <li>Style: Well, as you can plainly see I've gone all out on the stylishness of this
                                project. I
                                have
                                implemented intuitive color UX design, and drawn ideas and pallettes from CloudFlare
                                Design,
                                Adobe,
                                and other more nefarious corners of the internet. I hand wrote all the css from
                                scratch,
                                as
                                I
                                was a
                                little out of practive what with all this recent Python learning! </li>
                            <li>Review: I shall be going over the code to make sure of best practice, that athere
                                are
                                repetitions and optimisizing where possible. I shall then ask tutors / friends in
                                the
                                web
                                design / development world to take a look!</li>
                            <li>Interactivity: I am adding in elements of JavaScript to make the page(s) a bit more
                                fun
                                and
                                interactive! Stay tuned for more.</li>
                            <li>Extra mile: If i can make it in time, I would like to add in the Trello API
                                interactivity,
                                whereby I can add things to my trello board from the page itself.</li>

                            <h4>But what if we fail!? </h4>There are many reasons & causes why digital projects
                            fail?
                            Why might this be, you say?</p>
                            <li>Knowledge/Ability: The member of the project lack the ability to properly execute
                                their
                                plan. There is too much of a knowledge gap to be overcome by the usual methods of

                                and support.</li>
                            <li>Time Constraints: The project may have a deadline that is impending, either from the
                                client,
                                or from external pressures. One might think of the example of a <a

                                marketing and distribution strategy have a set date by which they are committed to

                                live.
                                Whether they are able to push back this date is often subject to major financial
                                factors.

                                wrong direction, or against the strengths of the members. Deliniation and delegation
                                can
                                be

                            Question 5:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                        <h4>CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON </h4> How would we go about choosing the right technologies for the
                        job?
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a much simpler question to answer in our case. We are making a webiste. We are
                            unable
                            to
                            do that without HTML, CSS, and some elements of JavaScript. But the choices dont stop
                            there.
                            What do we need for our back end, if any? Well, it might make sense for us to continue
                            using
                            JS
                            or even python as we've been spending so much time working on it recently!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But often these days, independent or smaller developers use tools like bootstrap and
                            libraries to
                            develop even quicker! These options, even things like Wordpress can be great for less
                            experienced developers and regular folk looking to put together something for personal
                            or
                            SMB
                            use.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Most companies have a standard set of technologies they use. But they might differ
                            slightly
                            from
                            team to team. From production to quality assurance say. For major companies they will
                            have
                            to
                            develop over a huge amount of technologies. Let's take the example of a the good old
                            British
                            retailer John Lewis. They will have hundreds of pages that must be accessible over many
                            devices,
                            apps, browsers, all accessing the same database, visual content and interactivity.
                            That's a
                            lot
                            of code. and multiple languages.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We've an easier task though of course, and as a test of ability and in order to push
                            myself I
                            shall only be using HTML, CSS JavaScript, and possibly python - all written straight
                            into
                            vscode. No shortcuts.</p>

                    <p>
                    <h4>It's Super Effective! </h4> The technologies I have chosen, specifically the ones I have
                    leanrt
                    and
                    implemented on this course, i.e. python, draw.io, Trello - have had a varying level of success
                    on
                    this
                    project.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Trello has been incredibly helpful. From start to finish, this wonderful Project Management
                        tool
                        allows the user to focus on the tasks at hand, whether creative or logic based, and takes
                        the
                        sting
                        out of working through a problem bit by bit. Knbocking items off yuor checklists and
                        priotising
                        them
                        accordingly. The Donbe section and code review have been incredibly helpful, both to see
                        your
                        progress thus far, and also to make sure you are on top of all tasks etc. </p>

                    <p>I have tried to implement my new found python knowledge into this page, but have had varying
                        degrees
                        of success - and whilst I undoubtably will b e putting them to good use soon enough, I have
                        fallen
                        back on trusty JavaScruipt in order to enable some site interactivity.</p>

                    <h3>Question 7:</h3>
                    <p>So, There's this thing called GDPR - it's great. It's really gtreat because it's there for
                        everyones
                        safety and protection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 2018, there was a piece of legistlation passed called The Data Protection Act, it was
                        installed by the
                        wonderful and now long lost ex-partner (BORRRIIIISSSSS!) of the European Union, and
                        something
                        that came
                        along with that was the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and passed into UK law. It
                        primarily
                        concerns how companies handle your data. Whether they can store it, and how they can use it
                        and
                        whether
                        or not you consent to that usage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, on my website, and on my project, GDPR doesn't massively effect come into play - I don't
                        have a
                        storage of usernames and passwords, nor am I planning to collect any user data. When I
                        implement
                        cookies at some point in the future - I WILL - be implementing a cookie consent form the
                        pops up
                        when
                        landing on the page.</p>
